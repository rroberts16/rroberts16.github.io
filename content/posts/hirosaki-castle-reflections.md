There may be millions of cherry blossoms petals here. It is the 28th of April. Fully fledged cherry blossom season, with trees colored pink and white. The wind gently scattering so many into the air. There is a worry that all the petals might be blown from the trees in an instant, but they remain enshrouded in color even with a shower of petals falling. It falls like snow. Two months ago it was the heart of winter. How similar it is, how one can take a deep breath and relax when snow or petals or rain falls from above. 

We cultivate these historic places. We maintained them, care for them, plant trees and rebuild buildings, maintain paths and keep a watchful eye on tourists too raucous. We do this why? Do we do it for legacy? Personal or communal? 

I cannot describe this place as peaceful. I sit in a constructed gazebo. Where in the near distant there is a circus performer with his loud neon speaker blaring. A kid behind me slurps his drink loudly while his family makes plans about what they will do for the rest of the day. But part of me loves it. The contrast of this place. Of history of beauty and the EDM music of the performer. The fact that families gather, children play. This is beauty all of it. I do not wish it was any different. Realize that this is it. Experience the full reality of this experience with open mind, body and breath.
